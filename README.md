# Pytorch-transformer-implementation

Several models of transformer series are developed with pytorch framework. 

Model implementation continues!

TODO : 

    - Write training code for the same model using huggingface library.
    - Work on modules for evaluation metrics such as GLUE and Squard, learn about the metric for each model and develop evaluation
    - When the path of raw text is inserted, it is converted into a format for model training (ex. mlm) and works a pipeline that even trains.
